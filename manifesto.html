		<p><b>Today is March 31. it is currently 11:44pm, and in 40 days from now, I will graduate from the College for Creative Studies and enter the world as a professional graphic designer.</b></p> 

<p>As i look reflect upon the last four years Ive spent as a design student, my understanding of the graphic design practice can be summed up by the following: I don’t know. As you browse through my portfolio of work I’ve produced these past few years, you may ask yourself just what exactly you’re looking at, and to be honest, I’m not entirely sure myself. All i know is that every single thing has something to do with graphic design, in one way or another. But the bigger question—one that’s remained in the back of my mind throughout the duration of my studies—is one of purpose: What exactly do graphic designers do? What role does a graphic designer play in the world in this day and age? Do we simply define form? That may have been the case 30 years ago, but the field of graphic design has changed a great deal since then. Nonetheless, It seems nobody can agree on an exact definition of it is we’ve spent countless hours devoting out lives to. How can it be that we designers can be so invested and devoted to something which we cannot fully explain to someone else?</p>

<p>This conflict can be quite struggling for a young designer, especially at first, but I believe that this current state of limbo in which the design profession currently exists is the most excited part about being a designer today. After many months & years of not being able to explain to friends and family what you’re even doing at 4am on a Sunday morning, and perhaps an existential crisis or two, you finally accept that “I don’t know.” I believe this to be the most pivotal point in a young designers career, because once it comes clear that the understanding of graphic design at this point in time does not definitively exist, you suddenly realize that you are free to form your own definition, and as an extension, define your own practice. Ill admit that the second semester of senior year may be a bit late for one to finally figure out what they’ve been doing all this time, but hey, everything is a process, right?</p> 

<p>Anyways, like I said earlier, everything you’ll find in this collection of my undergraduate work is representative of some aspect of graphic design, or at least my understanding of it. You’ll find solutions informed by extensive research, complex ideas reimagined through simple graphic forms, reappropriations of existing materials and systems, navigation systems informed by human behavioral science, use of color to evoke emotion, humor derived from language manipulation, automated processes using code and technology, storytelling through unsuspected  channels, and even simple demonstrations of technical ability.</p>



<p>By no means are these descriptions truly representative of graphic design, I believe that my work tells falls into the “more than meets the eye” trope, and thus cannot appropriately be summarized through a few words. That being said, what does this all have to do with my perception of graphic design? For one, I would argue that form is still of utmost importance: form study is as much graphic design as anything else. Form should never precede function, nor should it become the epitome of a designers practice, but nonetheless, form should be always undergo careful consideration in any project. This does not mean “making things look pretty;” in fact, intentional misuse of form may at times be more appropriate, depending on the concept and message meant to be communicated. Regardless, form is undoubtedly a characteristic component to the design practice, and should be handled with attentive snd conscious care.</p> 

<p>Perhaps the closest thing I’ve heard to a “summation” of graphic design comes from something I was told by my professor: “graphic design is making the complex simple.” Professedly a rather vague description, it nonetheless emphasized the importance of storytelling, and was ultimately very helpful for me at that time. If I were to finally profess my own understanding of design in proportionately simple terms, I would say that graphic design is creating (new) context for something that already exists. I say this with an extreme emphasis on context, which I would regard as the foundation for all communication. The power of a graphic designer stems directly from their ability to recontextualize everyday things in order to change public perceptions and  suggest new ideas. However, one must deeply understand the current context before they have the power to create a new one. Design is rooted deeply in society, current and past events, and lastly, the history of graphic design itself. As opposed to trying to break this connection, a designer should embrace it and learn how to use it to shape and elevate their work. Good graphic design borrows, juxtaposes, remixes, reflects, narrates, comments, and explains something that exists, but does so with a voice of its own.</p>

<p>Many would argue that design must be highly functional in order to be good, but what does functional even mean? Does it mean that design should be absolutely clear and understandable at all times? Can it also work on an emotional level and be highly unsettling, confusing, or mysterious? I would not only argue that it can, I would say that more often than not it should. After all, we humans are fascinated by the unknown, and it is our natural instinct to seek out clarity towards that in which we cannot comprehend. Now of course there are times in which design must fulfill a certain purpose with extreme clarity (such as highway signage,) but would a poster or a book not be unbelievably boring if treated the same way? I think so.</p> 

<p>Think of the last time you saw a confusing movie that only came together at the end or after a conversation with a friend, did the period of antagonizing confusion not intensify the feelings of satisfaction you felt once you put it all together? Did watching the movie a second time not completely change your understanding of the individual scenes and dialogues? Did that experience not stick with you for longer than than it would had it the film been completely transparent?  It is those moments we find ourselves reconsidering something that we previously believed to have understood that truly stick with us, and therefore de/decontextualization is a critical tool in a designers arsenal. And more often than not, this all comes down to how we treat the smallest details in our work.</p> 

<p>Regardless of what I’m working on (even as I sit here writing my manifesto in basic Text Edit,) I am constantly forced to make decisions; some are made quick, and some call for greater lengths of consideration, but nonetheless I am constantly thinking about the details, “fact checking” by decisions by asking myself “why?” If i can’t answer with a strong conviction, then I need to revisit that decision. When you stack up all the decisions—what type should i use? where should this go on the page? where should I put the folio? what color should i make my body copy? how big should by headlines be? what images should belong on this page? or should i use vector graphics instead? What kind of paper should I use? should I make a mobile app or a brochure? What should I name it?, etc. etc. etc.—you begin to answer a lot of “why”s, which if addressed in a thorough manner, form a complex story/message from the culmination of these simple choices. I believe that caring about these small things is essential to good design. Even though a lot of details might not be immediately visible to the viewer, they undoubtedly come together to create a certain feeling or mood that is fundamental to the perception of the work.</p> 

<p>Size, margins, relations, type size, color, etc may not be criteria of judgement for everyone, but as a designer you should care about those things. After all, who’s job is it but our own to educate our audience?</p>

<p>Additionally, any decision you have made in your process will easily become compromised if the same level of care is not applied to the smallest common denominators of your work. Again, this doesn’t mean things need to be clean and neat; it just means you should establish as system—a made up set of rules that accommodate for even the smallest details—and then stick to it.</p>
