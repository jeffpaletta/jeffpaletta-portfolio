			    On paper I call myself a communication <br>
			    designer, but that's really just an umbrella <br>
			    term I use to keep things succinct. I'm <br>
			    really just a problem solver who is always <br>
			    looking for a better way of doing things.</p>
			<p>
				As a kid I was building primitive “robots” <br>
				to do my chores for me, and as a teen I <br>
				was scheming up <s>romantic</s> creative <br>
				ways to ask my crush to the school <br>
				dance. Doing things the default way is <br>
				boring; there’s always a more exciting <br>
				means to accomplish the ends.</p>
			<p>
				I’m basically a grown-up version of the <br>
				annoying little kid who responds to every <br>
				statement with “why?” But sometimes <br>
				asking “why?” turns into a “what if?” My <br>
				portfolio is a collection of these moments: <br>
				fifteen different solutions that began by <br>
				asking questions an exploring new ideas.</p>
